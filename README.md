# Multi-label text classification with Naive Bayes and DistilBERT

We predict the genres of a movie from its summary (overview).

- First: Applying a classical Naive Bayes, cleaning (normalization, stop-words and stemming) and transforming the text with TF-IDF.
- Second: Applying DistilBERT on raw and tokenized text.
